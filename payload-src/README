This directory holds the sources of the files which together with a PIA runnable
jar file in the corresponding ./lib must be zipped into
  binaries_<env>.zip
and shipped for the corresponding environment.

Environments are:
  win_32
  win_64
  mac_64
  lnx_32
  lnx_64

The binaries.ini should hold the settings in a way which allows the calling of
the Java version used by KNIME.
